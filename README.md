## Overview
The Multi-Keyword Audio Recognition System aims to identify specific keywords within audio recordings. The project processes audio files by converting them into spectrograms, applying noise filters, and using a Siamese neural network to identify keywords through similarity measures. The system supports training with minimal examples using few-shot learning techniques.

## Features
- **Noise Filtering**: Reduces noise in audio files for better keyword detection.
- **Spectrogram Analysis**: Converts audio files into mel spectrograms for visual analysis.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Efficiently trains the model with limited examples.
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Leverages similarity-based learning to detect multiple keywords.
